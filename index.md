# About Me
Hi, thank you for visiting my page:)<br> I'm a M.S student, working with Prof. Myeongjae Jeon in OMNIA lab.<br>My research interest is continual learning, avoiding catastropic forgetting during training with new data and leveraging episodic memory efficiently under various scenarios. I'm also interested in resource-effcient deep learning inference & training. Please feel free to email me, if you have any question.
